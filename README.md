# Consume Plugin for Craft CMS
<img width="500" src="https://verbb.io/uploads/plugins/consume/consume-social-card.png?v=2">

Consume is a Craft CMS plugin for making HTTP requests in your Twig templates. Integrates with the [Auth](https://github.com/verbb/auth) module to make it possible to use OAuth clients without having to worry about refresh tokens, token management, etc.

It's your complete solution to fetch and consume data from third-party API providers.

## Features
- Create OAuth or Credential clients to make requests with. Save settings in the control panel to use in your templates.
- Create [Guzzle](https://docs.guzzlephp.org/en/stable/) requests in your Twig templates for on-demand data fetching.
- Parse JSON, XML and CSV responses from endpoints into arrays. Also supports HTML and raw text!
- Automatic cache control to save requests, or control it yourself with `{% cache %}` tags.
- Create your own OAuth or Credential clients with our `Generic` clients.
- Provides events to write your own clients.
